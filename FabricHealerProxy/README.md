# FabricHealerProxy 1.1.0

FabricHealerProxy is a .NET 8 library that provides a very simple and reliable way for any .NET Service Fabric service to initiate Service Fabric entity repair by the FabricHealer service running in the same cluster. You can install FabricHealerProxy into your .NET Service Fabric service from the [nuget.org package gallery](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ServiceFabricApps.FabricHealerProxy). 

### How to use FabricHealerProxy

- Deploy FabricHealer ([ARM](/Documentation/Deployment/Deployment.md), [PowerShell](/README.md#powershell-deployment)) to your cluster (Do note that if you deploy FabricHealer as a singleton partition 1 (versus -1), then FH will only conduct SF-related repairs).
- Install FabricHealerProxy nupkg into your own service from where you want to initiate repair of SF entities (stateful/stateless services, Fabric nodes).

FabricHealer will execute entity-related logic rules (housed in it's FabricNodeRules.guan file in this case), and if any of the rules succeed, then FH will create a Repair Job with pre and post safety checks (default),
orchestrate RM through to repair completion (FH will be the executor of the repair), emit repair step information via telemetry, local logging, and etw.

### Sample application (Stateless Service)

Stateless1.cs 

```C#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Fabric;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.ServiceFabric.Services.Runtime;
using FabricHealer;

namespace Stateless1
{
    /// <summary>
    /// An instance of this class is created for each service instance by the Service Fabric runtime.
    /// </summary>
    internal sealed class Stateless1 : StatelessService
    {
        public Stateless1(StatelessServiceContext context)
            : base(context)
        {

        }

        /// <summary>
        /// This is the main entry point for your service instance.

            // so make sure to craft a specific logic rule that makes sense for you (and use some logic!).
            // Note that, out of the box, FabricHealer's AppRules.guan file located in the FabricHealer project's PackageRoot/Config/LogicRules folder
            // already has a restart replica catch-all (applies to any service) rule that will restart the primary replica of
            // the specified service below, deployed to the a specified Fabric node. 
            // By default, if you only supply NodeName and ServiceName, then FabricHealerProxy assumes the target EntityType is Service. This is a convience to limit how many facts
